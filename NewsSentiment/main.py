<p><b>Business:</b> In marketing field companies use it to develop their strategies, to 
understand customers’ feelings towards products or brand, how people respond to 
their campaigns or product launches and why consumers don’t buy some products.</p>
 
<p><b>Politics:</b> In the political field, it is used to keep track of political view, 
to detect consistency and inconsistency between statements and actions at the 
government level. It can be used to predict election results as well!</p>

<p><b>Public Actions:</b> Sentiment analysis also is used to monitor and analyse social 
phenomena, for the spotting of potentially dangerous situations and determining 
the general mood of the blogosphere.</p>
