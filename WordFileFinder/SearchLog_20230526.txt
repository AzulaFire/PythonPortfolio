File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 28497] - Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 28499] - No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 28501] - neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 28641] - If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died.

File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 28878] - Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 28880] - But the man who loves God is known by God. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 29016] - If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.

File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 29294] - But just as you excel in everything--in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us --see that you also excel in this grace of giving. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 29295] - I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 29311] - Therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that the churches can see it. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 29318] - Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 29355] - Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do! 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 29392] - So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less?

File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 29813] - Therefore, my brothers, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, that is how you should stand firm in the Lord, dear friends! 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 29820] - Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 29844] - because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints-- 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 29845] - the faith and love that spring from the hope that is stored up for you in heaven and that you have already heard about in the word of truth, the gospel

File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 29958] - We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 29976] - But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love. He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us, just as we also long to see you.

File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 30244] - Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 30250] - People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 30251] - without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 30252] - treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God-- 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 30258] - You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 30275] - for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.

File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 30352] - yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul--an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus-- 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 30382] - You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy."

File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 30713] - Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?

File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 30985] - But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 30990] - Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 30995] - Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31010] - How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31019] - This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of God; nor is anyone who does not love his brother.

File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31023] - We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers. Anyone who does not love remains in death. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31025] - This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31026] - If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him?

File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31032] - And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31040] - Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31041] - Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31042] - This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31043] - This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31044] - Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31045] - No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31049] - And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him.

File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31051] - There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31052] - We love because he first loved us. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31053] - If anyone says, "I love God," yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31054] - And he has given us this command: Whoever loves God must also love his brother. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31055] - Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31056] - This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands.

File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31085] - And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another.

File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31099] - The elder, To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in the truth. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31104] - They have told the church about your love. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31107] - I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will have nothing to do with us. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31118] - Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, To those who have been called, who are loved by God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ: 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31119] - Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31129] - These men are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the slightest qualm--shepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without rain, blown along by the wind; autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted--twice dead. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31138] - Keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31153] - To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood, and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father--to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31171] - Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken your first love. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31186] - I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did at first. 
File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31205] - I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars--I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.

File: bible-niv.txt [Line: 31545] - Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
